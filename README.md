# Asteroid Bounce (Legacy)

This repository contains the original JavaScript source for **Asteroid Bounce**, 
a canvas-based browser game originally built using WinJS-era tooling.

The project is being modernized into a Vue 3 implementation as a learning 
and demonstration exercise, focusing on hosting an imperative game loop 
inside a reactive UI framework without rewriting core game logic.
